# print('heloo ashish')#it is statement + new line 
# 1..we can use single quotes inside double codes and vice cersa
# 2..we cannot use double  quotes inside double codes and same for single quotes to

# print("hello 'ashish' how are you")  
# print('hello "ashish" how are you')  






# but with the use of escape sequence we can doo the activity 2
#  \'  means single qoutes  '
#  \"  means double qoutes  " 
#  \\  means backslash    \
# print("hello \"ashish\" how are you")  
# print('hello \'ashish\' how are you')  




#for printing backslash we need double slash 
# print("this is single backslash\\")
# print("this is double backslash\\\\")

#  shortcut in print put r inside ...then all text will be treated normaly only including escape sequences 
# print(r"this is single \ \n backslash")
# print(r"this is double  \\n backslash")
